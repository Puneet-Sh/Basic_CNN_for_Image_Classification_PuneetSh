# 🧠 CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN (TensorFlow & Keras)

This project demonstrates how to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which includes 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

## 📂 Dataset

- **CIFAR-10**: Contains 50,000 training and 10,000 testing images.
- Classes: `airplane`, `automobile`, `bird`, `cat`, `deer`, `dog`, `frog`, `horse`, `ship`, `truck`.
